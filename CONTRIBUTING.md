# Contributing to the experiment

This is a hobby project exploring integer multiplication with AI, just for fun.
Corrections to the generated math, code, and source attribution are welcome
through issues or pull requests. The mathematical claims remain unreviewed.

For a mathematical issue, identify the exact proposition, source label, or
inequality; give a counterexample or the missing implication when possible;
and distinguish numerical validation from an algorithmic proof obligation.
For the current pair-star result, start with the
[AI-generated experiment notes](notes/complex-pair-star-note.tex) and their
[construction](notes/complex-pair-star-construction.tex). For retained baseline
dependencies, consult the
[compact-control review guide](docs/research/compact-control-review.md).
The [original audit](docs/audit.md) describes the retained upstream assumptions.

For a parameter improvement, supply exact rational choices, the full dependency
argument, and an updated patch against the pinned source. Explain whether the
change stays within the parameter ceiling or changes one of its hypotheses.

Keep `upstream/` unchanged. Edit the generators under `scripts/`, then run:

```sh
make verify
```

Include regenerated certificates and patches in the same change. If the note
changes, also run its corresponding PDF target (`make pair-star-note` for the
current result) and include the updated PDF. Review changes to
claims in the README and note together. Finite tests should address a mathematical
identity or a failure mode, rather than simply restating implementation details.

New contributions are under the repository's Apache-2.0 license. Retain source
attribution and disclose substantial AI assistance. Do not describe certificate
success as a formal verification of the full multiplication theorem.
