# Contribution review: release update and historical triage

The selected PR #39 chain has now passed the [conditional maintainer audit](community-final-audit.md)
and is incorporated in the community release at kappa=3.886675852e-5 > 2^-15.
The dated snapshot and original triage below are preserved as historical records;
their pending/non-import statements describe the earlier 2^-30 checkpoint.
PR #40 and later submissions remain outside this audit.

## Original triage record

Snapshot taken October 8, 2026. This is a triage index, not acceptance of any
submitted bound. No PR was merged, modified or commented on during release
preparation. The repository's included checkpoint remains conditional 2^-30.

## Overlap and attribution

[Zhihao Chen's PR #7](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/7)
was submitted before this checkpoint and contains the same F3 five-subset
motif, rational form I-(2/25)J, common-pair source-span argument and fixed
finite-alphabet direction. Its producer and center schedule differ, and it
claims a stronger bound. The release credits that earlier submission and
makes no priority claim for the motif. No PR #7 source code is imported.

[eumemic's PR #3](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/3)
was submitted after the local complex checkpoint commit `1c09a58`
(October 8, 01:10 UTC) and before this release. Its compressed complex circuit
and binary phase-frame argument are related work;
it is explicitly acknowledged. The included complex implementation and its
certificates remain those of the previous local 2^-31 commit.

The review so far read the PR descriptions and the pinned PR #7 construction
note, and inspected PR #34's dependency/reproduction entry point. It has not
reproduced their suites or independently audited their general tape and
precision arguments. A contributor's successful test report, or a large
headline in a PR title, is not treated as verification by this project.

## Review order

1. **Foundation: #3, #5, #7.** Review signed complex restoration and binary
   residuals, the faster Gaussian tape/error argument, and the retained-total
   ternary frame schedule. Reproduce the whole dependency chain with pinned
   inputs and preserve every contributor's attribution.
2. **Bulk recursive calls: #10 and #13.** Verify that contiguous projector
   blocks use one compatible controlled basis, that the actual children have
   the stated volume/width, and that the dependency-path guard covers every
   physical call. These changes appear to cross the singleton-rank recurrence
   limitation; the headline alone does not establish that step.
3. **Source frames, partial swaps and semantic precision: #18–#25.** Audit
   source/output endpoints, restoration, setup and row stock, and the exact
   semantic error propagation. Check changes to the Gaussian enclosure and
   resulting assembly rather than only rerunning rational inequalities.
4. **Two-stage topology: #29, #31, #33, #34.** Check the paid endpoint copy
   correction and complete physical list, the common-basis existence proof,
   exact rank partitions, and compatibility with every inherited interface.
   #34 is a small refinement of a long dependency chain, not a standalone
   proof of its final multiplication bound.
5. **Copied centers and fixed bases: #35–#39.** Check paid transforms and endpoint
   corrections, both invocation orientations, complete child lists and compatible
   bases. These layer on the earlier analytic and two-stage dependencies; a
   focused final-PR check is insufficient.
6. **Lean certificate PR #26.** Identify exactly which arithmetic statements
   are formalized and build them. Do not equate a certificate check with
   formalization of the full multiplication machine.

Any accepted stronger witness needs a coherent complete proof package,
reproducible artifacts, checked downstream substitutions, and provenance.
The independent 2^-30 checkpoint can be preserved even if a stronger
contribution later supersedes its headline.
