# Community contribution record

**Latest reviewed batch: #50–#62.** The [round-two ledger](docs/research/community-round2-review.md)
records the contribution and validation scope of every PR, including parallel
and superseded numerical witnesses. The selected result combines Avi Eisenberg,
eumemic and Alejandro Zarzuelo Urdiales. Rohan Gupta and Chafik Boukhalfa supplied
the preceding reviewed compiler composition; Rohan Arun, RaD / hipotures and
Rohan Garg supplied additional reviewed alternatives and tools.
Earlier contributors retain all credit. Entries below describe their dated checkpoints.


Thank you to everyone contributing proofs, constructions, parameter improvements,
independent implementations, checks, corrections and unsuccessful searches with
useful conclusions. Parallel work, small improvements and results later superseded
remain part of this project's research record. A contribution need not win the
headline to deserve acknowledgement.

This record accompanies the conditional **kappa=4.123863984e-5 > 2^-15**
community release and preserves the earlier **2^-30 checkpoint** credits. It
covers submissions recorded on October 8, 2026, including earlier work on the
2^-59 family and parallel contributions. The final witness is contributed by
**Rohan Arun (@rohanarun), PR #49**, with its full dependency chain retained. It is not a ranking of contributors or a determination of priority.
Descriptions below summarize the submitted work; inclusion does not imply that a
PR's mathematics has been independently verified or its code incorporated.

## Reviewed community release

The [follow-up maintainer review](docs/research/community-followup-review.md)
accepts the PR #49 circuit increment conditionally on the original #109 framework
and the [PR #39 audit](docs/research/community-final-audit.md). It composes Rohan
Arun's order search and matching with Chafik Boukhalfa's reordered sums and exact
recovery, and RaD/hipotures's alternating producers and physical compiler.

PR #45 by Alejandro Zarzuelo Urdiales and PR #26 by Ryan S are also incorporated.
Their pinned Lean builds, axiom audits and finite checks pass within their
stated scope; neither formalizes the whole multiplication theorem.
The [README contributor list](README.md#attribution) highlights incorporated
work, and the [integration record](docs/research/community-followup-integration.md)
preserves the reviewed heads. Earlier and parallel contributions remain credited.

## The historical 2^-34 to 2^-30 interval

The local complex-compression checkpoint was committed at `1c09a58` on October 8
at 01:10 UTC. eumemic's related complex construction in [#3](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/3)
was submitted at 02:23 UTC, and Rohan Arun's [#8](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/8)
provides another geometric complex candidate. These parallel contributions deserve
recognition alongside the local implementation. dleen's [#4](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/4)
adds retained totals and sharing; eumemic's [#5](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/5)
and [#6](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/6) claim stronger savings
through resampling and circuit changes. They were submitted before this release,
but are not dependencies silently imported into its proof.

Zhihao Chen's [#7](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/7) predates
this checkpoint's ternary implementation and contains the same F3 five-subset
motif, rational form and fixed-alphabet direction, with a different producer and
a stronger claimed bound. The checkpoint explicitly makes no priority claim for
that motif. Rohan Arun's [#9](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/9)
then refines its templates. Their submissions are credited even though this
checkpoint retains its separately checked producer and conservative assembly.

## Contributors and submitted work

Names follow the authors' supplied attribution where available; otherwise GitHub
handles are used. PR links preserve the full descriptions, co-credits and review
history. The [snapshot](docs/research/contribution-snapshot.json) pins every listed
submission, including closed PRs. The [review index](docs/research/contribution-review.md)
tracks acceptance separately.

The incoming two-stage work also credits **Swapnil Jain** for linked two-stage
batching development, alongside Aurel Prosz's topology and endpoint correction;
see [#29](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/29) and
[#36](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/36) for their pinned
external sources. The imported source notices and the completed audit record the scope in which
that development is used by the released composition. Zhihao's pinned note explicitly
credits Swapnil's research as the route to two-stage topology and macro batching.
Swapnil's later parallel repository is now [retained and checked](research/swapnil-parallel/README.md):
round-six network histograms are reproduced, both rounds' finite arithmetic is
cross-checked, and ten Lean declarations pass an axiom audit. This does not
replace the selected construction or independently prove his global transfer stack.

Closed [#11](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/11) records
matching/prime-power generalizations and bounded negative screens without a new
headline. Closed [#30](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/30)
preserves a concurrent near-balanced construction overtaken by another submitted
bound. Both remain credited. Review, replication, bug reports and documented
negative results are also welcome contributions.

## Attribution as integration proceeds

- Keep original authorship, licenses, source pins and substantial AI-assistance
  disclosures when importing code or proofs.
- Credit an idea's supplied source as well as the person who checks, improves or
  integrates it. Preserve explicit predecessor credits rather than crediting only
  the final PR in a chain.
- Record incorporated results, parallel work and pending review distinctly.
  A merged file is not a claim of external mathematical acceptance.
- Retain acknowledgements when a bound is superseded, a PR closes, or a duplicate
  implementation is not imported. Do not infer joint authorship of a proof from
  a general acknowledgement.
- Corrections to names, contribution descriptions, omitted work and source links
  are welcome through an issue or PR. This is a dated record, not an exhaustive
  account of everyone who has helped outside the repository.

Douglas Colkitt's local research and integration work used OpenAI Codex.
The original manuscript and the underlying Harvey–van der Hoeven analytic work
retain their existing attribution. Contributor-specific AI disclosures and
licenses remain attached to their original submissions; acknowledgement here
neither replaces those notices nor asserts independent human review.

## Follow-ups after the checkpoint snapshot

PRs #40–#49 were reviewed as a composed circuit and separate formal packages.
The [follow-up credit ledger](docs/research/community-followup-review.md#credit-for-the-composed-increment)
distinguishes each contribution, including parallel improvements. The original
39-PR snapshot remains an immutable historical record; the later reviewed heads
are recorded separately in the follow-up review and integration record.

## Additional public parallel efforts

- **Pranav Balakrishnan** ([pranavbalakri](https://github.com/pranavbalakri/integer-mult-bounds-improvement)) explored complex scratch sharing and announced a margin above 2^-31. The repository and [announcement](https://x.com/pranavbalakri/status/2108023898688401719) are recorded; a complete proof audit is outside this acknowledgement.
- **Kenny Daniel** ([platypii](https://github.com/platypii/integer-mult-bounds-lean), [announcement](https://x.com/platypii/status/2108110520876421162)) is developing a separate Lean formalization. Its end-to-end theorem remains work in progress.
- **mjones / @_numinit** [announced a parallel witness](https://x.com/_numinit/status/2108033292674990308) with a patch and Nix flake planned. No linked artifact or incorporated-code claim has been verified here.

The [announcement ledger](docs/research/contributor-announcements.md) and
[source receipt](docs/research/contributor-social-sources.json) distinguish
verified posts, profile associations and unresolved account identities.

- **Michiel Kosters** ([research repository](https://github.com/michielkosters/mathematics_ai/tree/2e0aa64ca09c87fc94f8575f59493f70cf929d71/problems/integer-multiplication-109); Douglas associates @one_line_proof) developed a parallel weighted-hypergraph/coordinate-frame candidate, compressed centers and aligned bit pairing. Our [review](research/parallel-announcements/README.md) reproduces the finite certificate with its transfer/precision limitations explicit.
- **Abe / @abe_asfaw**, via a suggestion supplied by Douglas, identified the redundant complex center and its historical 26.5% numerical gain. We [checked the scalar identity, counts and assembly arithmetic](research/parallel-announcements/README.md), and credit this parallel observation alongside the already preserved rank-h center research.
