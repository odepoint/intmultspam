# A sharper exponent for integer multiplication

**Community research maintained by Douglas Colkitt — conditional on the original
OpenAI #109 framework.**

The reviewed community witness gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\boxed{\kappa=\frac{4123863984}{10^{14}}
=4.123863984\times10^{-5}>2^{-15}}.
$$

This uses the fixed finite-alphabet Turing-machine model with a fixed number of
one-dimensional tapes in OpenAI's
[*Integer multiplication below n log n*](https://github.com/openai/math/tree/adc7f1241b42e322a6451854ab7e4b4c146bf78a/preprints/Integer-multiplication-below-n-log-n-September-23-2026).
The saving is **6.10% above our previous PR #39 release**, and still below 2^-14. These numbers compare
asymptotic exponent savings, not practical running times.

**Latest circuit contribution: [Rohan Arun (@rohanarun), PR #49](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/49).**
This composes **Chafik Boukhalfa's** reordered exclusion sums and exact recovery,
**RaD / hipotures's** alternating producers and physical compiler, and Rohan's
weighted matching and order search. Their full dependency chain and
AI-assistance disclosures remain credited in the source notices.

## Additional conditional composition: dual-skip strips with joint frames

The [joint-dual proof and reproduction guide](research/joint-dual/README.md)
gives **κ=475073569/10^13=4.75073569e-5**, approximately **1.7409637424%**
above PR57's stated conditional saving. It composes **Rohan Gupta's PR55
dual-skip graph** with **eumemic's PR57 joint frame compiler**, retaining the
original-envelope pipeline, exact recovery and all predecessor credits.
This is an additional conditional witness; it does not extend the scope
of the maintainer-reviewed community result above.

The physical roles are R23=30790 and R25=40446, giving W=150593466. The
[exact certificate](certificates/joint-dual-kappa.json) checks the complete
recursive child list and all 47 strict assembly inequalities/seven margins.
`make joint-dual-verify` regenerates both physical words, replays every dirty
basis vector, independently reconstructs transitions and recertifies the
actual fixed-I+J profiles. `make verify` retains all preceding checks.

## What changed

The community work combines recursive batching and partial-swap frames with
semantic precision bounds, arbitrary-coordinate routing and bulk Gaussian
resampling. Two-stage circuits, paid copied-center operations and improved
contiguous blocks strengthen the finite networks. The latest increment
reorders disjoint sums and retains more compatible carriers, with both local
bases fixed and the entire physical circuit replayed exactly.

The selected bit network has m=575 and 177,284,805 roles. Its recursive saving
is 4124034054/10^14; the unchanged complex network supplies 717/10^7.
The assembly retains all seven strict exponent margins, including numerical,
movement and normalization costs.

Also incorporated: **Alejandro Zarzuelo Urdiales's Gaussian parity and finite
tensor proofs (PR #45)** and **Ryan S's historical Lean certificates and circuit
checks (PR #26)**. These strengthen verification within their stated scope;
they do not change κ or formally verify the complete multiplication theorem.

## Evidence and limits

The selected contribution is PR #49 at `f95d2910e027495983b53cae1693cf535abf2569`.
The [follow-up review](docs/research/community-followup-review.md) accepts its
increment conditionally on the retained [PR #39 audit](docs/research/community-final-audit.md)
and original #109 framework. This is not a claim of full formal verification,
independent human peer review, worldwide priority or optimality. No complete
practical multiplication-machine implementation is supplied.

Validation includes fresh finite producers, exact rank profiles, full dirty
workspace restoration, historical patch checks and an independent rational
moment/assembly checker. Both formal submissions were built with their pinned
Lean versions; their axiom audits accept only Lean's standard axioms.
See the [review receipts](docs/research/community-followup-validation.json) and
[combined integration record](docs/research/community-followup-integration.md).

The earlier PR #39 release and **2^-30 checkpoint** (`1a74950`) remain preserved,
with all earlier certificates, proofs, patches and contributor notices.

## Reproduce

Requires Python 3.11 or newer, Git, Make and a C++17 compiler with unsigned
128-bit integer support (tested with GCC and Clang). No third-party Python
packages or network access are needed for the arithmetic/circuit verification.
The separate formal targets require Lean and an initial toolchain/Mathlib download.

```sh
make verify
git diff --exit-code -- certificates patches
```

For the final witness and the independent arithmetic/source audit:

```sh
make copied-fixed-verify climbed-48-verify
make community-followup-check
make formal-verify
```

Allow several minutes and multiple gigabytes of memory for full producer
rebuilds. See [reproduction details](docs/reproducibility.md).
